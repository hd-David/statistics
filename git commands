 ### GIT
 Git is a clear source drew up to virsionalise the control system made up to handle everything from
 small to big projects with speed and efficiency; whenever the added codes are becoming
  more, git changes the codes stored. Git has a remote repository which is stored in a server and a local
   repository stored in a computer. Drew up virsion control system helps in handldling this by maintaining a history of what changes have been made, it also provides features like 
 branches and merges which will be covered thereafter.
  In git we have command drew up to be followed when using git. we have commants like;
 - git init hwich is used to open a new enpty reporsitory. It can be that you're working on an existing
 reporsitory and then you think of switching to new reporsitory, git init is the only command that has 
 power to command the opening of a new reporsitory.
 - git add command add new or charnded files in your workimg directory to the straging area. withouth 
 this command nothing can be done because it can allow the user to access histry of the written 
 data without charnging your working environment. Git add is used when workimg with git before you commit
 you firstly type git add to give you access of choice of a selected file which you want to commiy.
 - we also have git checkoup this is the commsand that than dirrect the user on the branches available
 and giving the name of a current branch, and you can switch these branches using checkout commant
 and access that git branch.
 - git pull is also another very inportant command. this commant is used to pic and download the content
 freom a remote repository and quickly give an update to a local reporsitory in order to resemble the 
 content. it is therefore a combination of two other git commands which are git fetch and git merge 
 it does the two commands in itself a one time, git fetch takes the first part by downloading the content
 fron a given file then merging pick it up to function into the remote content to allow merge commit to 
 take place.
 - git rm it is used to delete the file in a reporsitory and from the filesystem.
 git has its main function which is removing marcked files from the both the index and the working 
 directory, it also walk with specification of what the user want to delete from the file before 
 giving a command. 
 - git clone, this command is used to make a reporsitory in an already existing repository.   
- git branch it lists all the branches from the working environment and add a branch aguement to creat 
another branch name branch.
- git status it plays a role of listing all the starged, unstarged aslo the untrached files.
